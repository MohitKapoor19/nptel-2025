**4. How does hedonic adaptation to positive events compare to adaptation to negative events?**

- Adaptation to positive events is slower and less complete.
    
- Adaptation to positive events is faster and more complete.
    
- There is no difference in adaptation between positive and negative events.
    
- Positive events have no impact on long-term happiness.  
    **Answer:** Adaptation to positive events is faster and more complete

**5. What does the research on hedonic adaptation suggest about the pursuit of happiness?**

- Happiness can be permanently increased through positive life events.
    
- Hedonic adaptation to positive events may be an obstacle in the pursuit of happiness.
    
- Negative events have no impact on long-term happiness.

**6. Why do life circumstances account for a small percentage of happiness variance?**

- Because life circumstances are not important for happiness.
    
- Because people adapt to life circumstances through hedonic adaptation.
    
- Because life circumstances are random and unreliable.
    
- Because life circumstances are too difficult to measure.  
    **Answer:** Because people adapt to life circumstances through hedonic adaptation

**9. Why are intentional activities less likely to lead to hedonic adaptation compared to life circumstances?**

- Because they are chronic and permanent.
    
- Because they are transient, episodic, and can be varied.
    
- Because they are entirely outside of our control.
    
- Because they are genetically determined.  
    **Answer:** Because they are transient, episodic, and can be varied
